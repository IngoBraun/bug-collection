# Bug collection: analyis and prevention

## Motivation
- reduce the bug rate in your software project - in a structural way! (not just bug by bug)

## Prequisites

- in order to talk about bugs, create a psychological safe environment in your team
- see a bug as a possibility to learn
    - ask the question, how to prevent this bug
    - the 5-why-method, root-cause-analysis, poka-yoke may help you
    
companies with proacative bug management are usually more successful!    

## Bug Collection

Collect the bugs of your software-project in a simple table monthly.

- Dpn't spend time with sphisticated tooling, focus on learning!
- beside description, cause as columns in your table - add category and testability as columns
- cluster by category

if you have a architectural overview, pin the bugs in this big picture to visualize them!

you can also visualize a buggy process with its steps to make problems transparent.

## Theoretical foundation
- bugs statistically concentrate in few places, they are not evenly distributed in a software system
- find theses concentrations by clustering (module, skill, process step - be creative!)

## Conclusions
- talking in a constructive and safe atmosphere about bugs makes people more sensitive and creative in order to prevent bugs
- it's more fun in the team!!!
