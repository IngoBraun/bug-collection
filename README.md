# Bug collection: analyis and prevention

Collect the bugs of your software-project in a simple table monthly.

## Prequisites

- in order to talk about bugs, create a psychological safe environment in your team
- see a bug as a possibility to learn
    - ask the question, how to prevent this bug
    - the 5-why-method, root-cause-analysis, poka-yoke may help you
    
companies with proacative bug management are usually more successful!    

## Bug Collection
- collect bugs in a simple table - don't spend time with tooling, focus on learning
- beside description, cause - add category and testability as columns
- cluster by category

## Theoretical foundation
- bugs statistically concentrate in few places, they are not evenly distributed in a software system
- find theses concentrations by clustering (module, skill, process step - be creative!)

## Conclusions
- talking in a constructive and safe atmosphere about bugs makes people more sensitive and creative in order to prevent bugs
- it's more fun in the team!!!
